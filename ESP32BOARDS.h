possibility of sending one piece of it as a thank you to the author :)

Edit this file to choose your target processor and FLASH size
If for some reason you are using a target not here, add the new
target following the examples of the existing targets and request
an update on the main repository please.

I do not recommend using 4M flash as the firmware for most platforms
currently has over 1M (and considering space for OTA and file system)
leaving little room for new features.

Also edit this file to select the LED behavior you want and the GPIO
PIN and type of led use.
